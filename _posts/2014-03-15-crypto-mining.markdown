Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin are popping all over
the news these days. With the ever-growing investment and market capitalization, 
it is clear that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Even during this seemingly 
nascent stage in their evolution, cryptocurrencies are already having a 
profound impact on the "real-world"; whether for good, as in the case of
philanthropic Dogecoin's community; the bad, such as the downfall of Mt.Gox and 
450 million dollar loss of its customers' money; and the ugly, like money 
laundering and criminal activity facilitation.

So to say the least, cryptocurrency is something new and exciting, which
I wanted to understand better and experience first-hand. A mining-rig
was in order.

For the rig, I've used similar specs as described on:

**What I Mine**

Any *scrypt* coins since GPU mining is still viable for these. I originally got
into mining Dogecoin, but moved to mining in a multipool since. I would say Dogecoin
is still my preferred coin due its vibrant community, growth potential, and capitalization.

*To the moon!*

**Hardware Specs**

|                     |                 |
|:--------------------|:--------------- |
| *Motherboard*       | ` ASUS M5A97 R2.0` |
| *CPU*               | ` AMD Sempron 145` |
| *Hard Drive*        | ` 32 GB SATA III Internal Solid State Drive` |
| *Memory*            | ` Kingston Hyper X Blu 4 GB 1600MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 Desktop Memory` |
| *3 x Video Cards*   | ` Sapphire Vapour-X R9 280X OC Edition` |
| *Power Supply*      | ` Seasonic 80 Plus Platinum 1000W` |
| *Riser Cables*      | ` 2x PCI-E Express 16x (non-powered) and 1x PCI-E 1X to 16X (powered)` |


Additionally, I've tired using a couple of different wireless network cards, but the connections
were intermittent, which affected the overall hash-rate.

**Glorious Rig**

**cgminer 3.7.2 config**

The following is my cgminer config. I'm pretty sure I'm squeezing the most out of the GPUs
with this config. The cards run HOT, sometimes pushing over 90â„ƒ, so additional heat removal 
may be required.

**Hash Rate**

**Tips**

- Be careful with un-powered riser cables, especially 1x, as your mobo could potentially fry.
- Multipools, such as [ultimatecoinpool.com](http://ultimatecoinpool.com) will mine the most profitable coin at the time,
  hence maximizing your profit.
- Encrypt and backup your wallet!
- Lots of info on [reddit](http://reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency)
